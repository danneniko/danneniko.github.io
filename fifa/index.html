    <p>The FIFA companion app is an unofficial project made for the Interaction Design course at Malm√∂ University.</p>
    <p>In a group of four, we were assigned a task where we had to solve a problem with design.
    We picked the console game FIFA for this.</p>
    <p>We found that the online aspect of this game is a bit slow at times, so we wanted to speed things up.
    For instance, when an opponent pauses the game online, you have to wait up to 45 seconds and do nothing.
    This happens when the player wants to change players or just take a little break.</p>
    <p>So we found a way to prevent the stalling, since it easily breaks the gameflow/momentum.
    A companion app where the players can change tactics during gameplay.</p>
    <p>Taking inspiration from the actual FIFA game for handheld devices, 
    I was responsible for the design and the development of this app. It is available <a href="http://fifa.danielnikolovski.com">here. </a>You can try drag and dropping players and changing formations.</p>
