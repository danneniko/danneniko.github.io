    <p class="cool">Mobile optimization</p>

    <p>Lund is a city with a high turnover on new visitors. New students, businessmen from all over the world visiting the international corporations and even a few tourists.</p>
    <p>The likely scenario in this case is that a lot of these visitors are apt to use their phones and tablets to guide themselves through the city.</p>

    <p>I got in touch with Glorias, one of the most famous resturants in Lund. After a cup of coffee with one of the co-owners, there was no doubt about their willingness to to optimize the website for this target group.</p>
    <p>With an initial sketch, I proposed which parts are the most important ones to cast light upon for a mobile visitor:</p>
    <ul class="postul">
        <li><p>The opening hours should be easily spotted</p></li>
        <li><p>It has to be very straightforward to navigate to the restaurant</p></li>
        <li><p>One should easily be able to click and call the restaurant to book a table</p></li>
        <li><p>The menu</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Through a good collaboration with their graphical designer, the result was a successful solution which maintained the original company profile.</p>
