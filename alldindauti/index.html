    <p>I got the privilege to work with a very talented 3D Artist who has done work for respectable brands 
    like Lego, Reebok, Gore-tex &amp; more.</p>
    <p>Alldin Dauti knew exactly what he wanted as for his website. He wanted a horizontal scrolling website
    where the content is delivered to the visitor at the center of the screen.</p>
    <p>To further strenghten the congruence of being a 3D artist, he wanted the portfolio items to transform in a 
    3D manner when they are being viewed. The result can be seen <a href="http://alldindauti.com">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I have put emphasis on his work, which is the first thing visitors/clients want to see when they visit
    the portfolio of a VFX/3D artist.</p>
    <p>It is also a very important aspect to be able to quickly see the next project without having to go back
    to the portfolio, hence the scrollable work content.</p>
