    <p>Slugfeast is a HTML5 game I developed using <a href="http://phaser.io/" target="_blank">phaser.io</a> during my Interaction Design studies.</p>
    <p>After picking up the basics of Arduino coding, we decided to use it as a game controller.
    We knew it would be a huge challenge since Arduino doesn't serially communicate to the browser.
    This is when I learned the basics of node.js and socket.io.</p>
    <p>To allow Arduino to communicate with the browser, socket.io was one of the very few options that were available.</p>
    <p>A non-Arduino version of this game can be found <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/sites/slugfeast">here</a>. Use
    space to shoot, and up/down arrows to control the angle.</p>
