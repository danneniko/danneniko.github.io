    <p>A Malmö-based company (One2tel Malmö) needed an easy way to track their orders.</p>
    <p>Along with a former Microsoft employee, a back-end developer by the name of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/doug-gale/a2/275/251" target="_blank">Doug Gale</a>, I created a powerful PHP-based order management system for telecom industries.</p>
    <p>I was responsible for the full management process and the UI design.</p>

    <p>There were several problems to solve within this project, and I really learned the impact of having a rock solid plan before going into development.</p>
    <p>Plan for all potential problems ahead, but still keep an open mind and be flexible for better solutions along the way. That's the recipe that turned this project into a possibility despite working with an overseas developer through Skype.</p>

    <p>We customized Bagasell exclusively for cold-calling within the telecom industry. That is, the employees call customers and sell them extensions of their phone subscriptions.</p>
    <p>Since it's a hard closing market where an employee might close anywhere between 1-20 customers per day, we had to make it quick and easy for them to register their sales so they can maintain their focus on what's important for them.</p>
    <p>We used autocompletes, preset dropdowns, an easy-to-use edit mode &amp; more.</p>

    <p>A way to place an order for the future, which makes sense for the telecom industry, was a requirement.</p>
    <p>This was one of the many problems we faced. Some customers had subscriptions that ended in a month from the sales date, so there had to be a way for the employees to remember to register those sales. This also prevents other employees to "steal" someone elses customer by mistake.</p>
    <p>We also added an obvious comment system which makes it possible for the employees to communicate with their sales service department.</p>

    <p>The order history section allows users and managers to get a quick visual overview of what's new, what's pending, what's registered &amp; more.</p>
    <p>It also allows the users to quick-edit their order, place additional comments, get a quick-view of the customer they sold to &amp; more.</p>
    <p>We also added a daterange picker, an ajax search system that automatically updates the rows upon searching, filters &amp; pagination</p>
