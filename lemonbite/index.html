    <p>A friend of mine who had a history as a salesperson wanted to start selling websites cold-calling.</p>
    <p>He wanted a very simple and visually clean website with a brief information about the company.
    Smooth and subtle CSS3 animations, a simple grid and we were ready to go.</p>
    <p>However, he found out that selling websites cold-calling wasn't the easiest task, since
    most clients actually require massive trust in their webdesign company before they even think about going into work.
    Using the phone as a sales weapon isn't the optimal way to go about sales in the design industry.</p>

    <p>Despite that, this was probably the most important project for me as a freelancer. It allowed me to
    understand a whole lot about building trust with clients and how important it is to be extremely professional as a designer.</p>
    <p>It was also this project that fueled my passion for web related work and business on the whole.</p>
