    <p>Tjänster was a fictive project from the days of the Interaction Design course at Malmö University.</p>
    <p>We were divided in groups of three and we were assigned a task where we had to aim towards cashless 
    exchange of services. Our first thought was to create a simple website for trading services for free,
    for the sake of good will.</p>
    <p>After the market research and during our creative process, we joked about turning it into a game instead,
    where one could level up and unlock achievables. We actually ended up going for it, and we ran some usability tests on it
    as soon as our first prototype was finished.</p>

    <p>Initially, the user tests showed us that the idea was a bit difficult to understand at first glance.
    We made a few changes, also adding a landing page that allowed the users to quickly understand our concept
    and a quick login option so they could get started before they would get bored trying to grasp the idea.</p>
    <p>Once we simplified it in this manner, we recieved tremendously good feedback from our new test groups.
    They found the concept very innovatory and most of them were open to actually be using the service if it
    became reality.</p>
    <p>I was responsible for designing the UI and developing the website in this project.
    I used some components from the<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"> Twitter Bootstrap</a> framework to save some 
    time since the deadline was realtively short.</p>
