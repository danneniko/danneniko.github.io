    <p>Freespin Bonanza is a community for online casino reviews.</p>
    <p>The website had to have an old feel to it. 
    The brand is aiming to relate to the old saloon gambling houses from the western era.</p>
    <p>A website of this kind needs to build massive trust and comfort among the visitors in 
    order to have any sort of impact. Hence the saloon-ish wooden menu, the wooden logo &amp;
    the mood-setting background images.</p>
    <p>My role was to design the wordpress theme, built upon html5blank, where the foundations of 
    the core PHP is already done. Being mainly a designer and not a PHP-developer, I still managed to build this
    website according to the plan.

    <p>I used a masonry grid for the different reviews, and a very straightforward approach designwise. Where the
    visitors have full overview of the different offers.</p>
    <p>On a type of website where the information easily can become overwhelming, I found it important to structure
    it in this manner.</p>
    <p>Since over 35% of the visitors use mobile devices, I used media queries to optimize it for all devices. 
    The information should be as easily accessible for mobile devices as it is for desktops.</p>
