<h1 class="postheader">Who I am</h1>

<p class="cool">I create thoughtful digital solutions that inspire your prospects to stay until they find what they are looking for.</p>

<p>My interest in web design started when I was 15 years old. What really kept interest is the fact that I love to solve problems and create stuff that make an impact on people's lives.</p>

<p>Occasionally I hang out in various design communities and try to help other designers with various problems, not least also give myself a lot of new knowledge. Places like IRC, <a href="https://www.codementor.io/danneniko" target="blank">Codementor</a> &amp; other social networks.</p>


<p>When I'm not working, I love to spend time with my amazing girlfriend who often bring in creative ideas. And I like to play tennis (which I'm honestly suck at), video games and run marathons (yeah right).</p>


<h2 class="postheader">When you hire me, you get</h2>
<ul class="postul">
<li><p>Someone that cares about your brand</p></li>
<li><p>Someone who does a wholehearted job</p></li>
<li><p>Someone who understands your customers</p></li>
<li><p>Someone who is more than happy to share knowledge</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of fun</p></li>
<li><p>Someone you can turn to after the project, for tips and ideas or just to grab a coffee</p></li>
</ul>
