    <p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.additude.se/" target="blank">Additude Group</a>, I got introduced to the international digital agency <a href="http://ustwo.com" target="_blank">UsTwo</a>. They have worked along with some of the most powerful brands in the world. They are also well known for their award-winning mobile game <a href="http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/" target="_blank">Monument Valley</a>. So I guess it's needless to say that I felt very honored to work with them in the making of a promotion site for their banking client <a href="http://nystart.sparbankensyd.se" target="_blank">Sparbanken Syd</a>.</p>

    <p>Along with one of their inhouse visual designers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jeremy-godefroid/30/a/711/" target="blank">Jeremy Godefroid</a> and one of their UX designers by the name <a href="https://se.linkedin.com/in/wayneminton" target="blank">Wayne Minton</a>, we faced a lot of fun challenges and created a customer experience which was widely appreciated by the client in the end.</a>

    <p>My role was to develop their new promotional <a href="http://nystart.sparbankensyd.se" target="_blank">landing page</a>, a Wordpress site which the client could easily have full control over. And the signup form for the new campaign, a more advanced kind of form where I used Angular on the front end. It can be seen <a href="http://nystart.sparbankensyd.se/bli-kund" target="_blank">here</a>

    <p>This journey was probably the most fun project I've worked on so far, and got to learn a great amount of new things when it comes to teamwork, deadline management, planning but also gained some new development knowledge.</p>
