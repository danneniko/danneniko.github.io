I just started reading [Cashvertising](http://amzn.com/1601630328/?tag=danienikol-20){:target="_blank"} which was recommended to me by the successful internet marketer [Charles Ngo](http://charlesngo.com/){:target="_blank"}. I can recommend anyone interested in marketing or basic human psychology to pick it up, it is absolutely mindblowing.

In the book, Whitman mentions the 8 desires we all have biologically programmed in us.


1. Survival, enjoyment of life, life extension.
2. Enjoyment of food and beverages.
3. Freedom from fear, pain, and danger.
4. Sexual companionship.
5. Comfortable living conditions.
6. To be superior, winning, keeping up with the Joneses.
7. Care and protection of loved ones.
8. Social approval.

This got me thinking of another desire which he never mentions, but still a desire we all seem to have to an extent.. **The need to accomplish something!** The need to feel like we’re doing something important, whether it is on a conscious or subconscious level.

Ever fallen into the trap of “I have to finish reading those never-ending articles on a certain subject before I can start doing anything else” or “Oh a new email, must read it!”

Or have you ever had nights where you stayed up all night to watch a whole bunch of Mad Men episodes, or any other series just to having finished watching all episodes. Because deep down.. it feels like an accomplishment.

The worst way to hack your brain thinking you’re accomplishing something is probably gaming. Nowadays games are so easy to access through your mobile. They are full of “accomplishments” which you can achieve. Because it is just so “important” to get more and more and more and more achievements. It’s just hacking ourselves into thinking we’re actually achieving something real.

Now of course I’m not saying never to enjoy yourself with recreational activities, one certainly must have ways to de-stress in order to not get burned out. In order to maximize productivity however, one should be aware of overexposure to small comfort-zone traps or even self-imposed mind tricks of this kind.

Hell even the urge to scroll through your social media accounts feels like something we simply must do nowadays. Now scrolling through facebook or any other social platform might be part of your brand strategy but you get the point.

Maybe I’m speaking just for myself here, I am in no way a neuroscientific researcher or so but I know for certain I’m not the only one with the strong desire to accomplish.
