    <p>Most restaurant owners are aware of the importance of having a website that’s optimized for mobile visitors. Over 80% of the typical target group for restaurants are using internet in their mobiles daily. <br>Source: <a href="http://www.internetstatistik.se/" target="blank">internetstatistik.se</a></p>

    <p>Most of us recognize the situation when you are out and about, and suddenly you get hungry.
    You pick up your mobile phone, search for the best restaurant nearby, you check their menu out, their opening hours etc.
    <br>In a situation like this, it’s very frustrating having to mess around with a website that isn’t optimized for mobiles. A website where the text is hard to read, a website where you can’t find the information you instantly need. You are hungry and possibly prone to haviing low patience, the last thing you want to do is dig for information longer than you should.</p>

    <p>So what’s the result of all this?<br>
    Well, you skip the non-optimized website and go straight to the competitors website, where you can clearly see where the restaurant is located, the menu easily accessible and the phone number right there for you to click and call.</p>

    <p>The managers at Plockepinn were well aware with the importance of embracing visitors from mobile devices, with the customers expectations well met.
    Though their current website wasn’t optimized for updates, most of the stuff was hard coded and they couldn’t even update Wordpress without the whole thing falling apart, which unfortunately left their whole site with huge security holes.</p>
    <p>My initial assignment was to optimize their site for mobile devices and make smaller adjustments to fonts, margins, grid etc. But soon I realized their whole theme had to be rebuilt before these changes could be done properly.</p>
    <p>The only real challenge that arised was the design of their lunch menu. It needed a second thought before it could be automated to fulfill their requests.<br>
    The solution resulted in a huge relief for those responsible of the website, which was highly appreciated because they’d rather put their focus on more important tasks than having to mess around with the website over tasks that should be very straightforward.
