    <p class="cool">Mobile Optimization</p>

    <p>I was given the privilege to work with <a href="http://peterlandgren.se" target="_blank">Peter Landgren &amp; Co</a>, the largest real estate company of south Sweden.</p>
    <p>After networking with their marketing director, they gave me an assignment to redesign the mobile version of their website.</p>
    <p>Their brand identity wasn't pushing through for mobile visitors like it did on their desktop version. They wanted the mobile visitors to recognize that they were still on the same website.</p>
    <p>Upon finishing the mobile redesign, I was assigned new tasks by this client.</p>
